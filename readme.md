# DIY Map

While organising meetings, nights out, dinners and so on as a group, it is common to encounter many inconveniences. Current social media fails to bring people together on real-time update of group activities and often causes confusion among people who want to join later to the group. DIY Map is a service where we could provide our friends with information on our current location so that any users of this service can grasp the event in one sight.
